# About Weather app
This is a simple weather app built using Kotlin that allows users to get real-time weather 
information for their current location. The app fetches weather data from an external API 
based on the user's latitude and longitude and displays the temperature, weather conditions,
and other related details.

# Features:

Get Current Weather: The app uses the device's location services to determine the user's 
current location and fetches real-time weather data from an API.

Display Weather Details: The app displays weather details such as temperature, 
weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy), humidity, wind speed, and more.

Responsive UI: The user interface is designed to be responsive and provide a smooth 
experience on different screen sizes.
